# A Non-Euclidean Web

## Description

The Non-Euclidean Web Extension is an innovative browser add-on that transforms your web browsing experience into a mind-bending journey through various non-Euclidean geometries. This extension applies complex mathematical transformations to web pages, allowing users to explore the internet in hyperbolic, spherical, Poincaré disk, Klein model, and custom non-Euclidean spaces.

## Features

- Multiple non-Euclidean geometry options: 
  - Hyperbolic
  - Spherical
  - Poincaré Disk
  - Klein Model
  - Möbius Strip
  - HyperSphere (combination of hyperbolic and spherical)
  - Custom Non-Euclidean
- Real-time transformation preview
- Adjustable transformation strength, curvature, and distortion factor
- Selective element transformation (all elements, text only, images only, links only, or custom selector)
- Custom cursor effects for each geometry type
- Viewport-wide distortion effects
- Detailed overlay with current geometry information
- Preset saving and loading functionality
- Configuration sharing via URL
- Geometry Tour mode for showcasing different non-Euclidean spaces
- Fractal mode for recursive transformations
- Exploration mode for dynamic geometry shifts
- Audio feedback that changes based on the current geometry
- Non-Euclidean screenshot feature

## Installation

### For Brave Browser

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open Brave and navigate to `brave://extensions`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing the extension files.

### For Firefox (Coming Soon)

Firefox support is currently in development and will be available in a future release.

## Usage

1. Click on the extension icon in your browser toolbar to open the control panel.
2. Select a geometry type from the dropdown menu.
3. Adjust the transformation strength, curvature, and distortion factor using the sliders.
4. Choose which elements you want to affect with the transformation.
5. Click "Apply Transformation" to see the changes on the current web page.
6. Use the "Start Geometry Tour" button to cycle through different non-Euclidean spaces automatically.
7. Enable "Fractal Mode" to apply transformations recursively to nested elements.
8. Click "Start Exploration Mode" to experience slowly shifting geometries over time.
9. Toggle "Enable Audio" to hear sound effects that change based on the current geometry.
10. Use the "Take Non-Euclidean Screenshot" button to capture and save the distorted view.
