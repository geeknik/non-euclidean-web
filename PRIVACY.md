# Privacy Policy for Non-Euclidean Web Extension

## Introduction

The Non-Euclidean Web Extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our browser extension.

## Information Collection and Use

The Non-Euclidean Web Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or browsing data. All transformations and settings are processed locally within your browser.

### Local Storage

The extension uses your browser's local storage to save your preferences and custom presets. This information is stored entirely on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.

### Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function:

- `activeTab`: This allows the extension to apply transformations to the current web page.
- `storage`: This is used to save your preferences and custom presets locally.

These permissions are used solely for the functionality of the extension and do not involve data collection or transmission.

## Data Sharing and Transfer

As we do not collect any data, there is no sharing or transfer of personal information to third parties.

## Security

While the extension itself does not handle sensitive data, we encourage users to keep their browsers updated to ensure the latest security features are in place.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the version number of the extension.
